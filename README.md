# Fibonacci-Algorithm-Comparison-

This program looks at two ways of computing Fibonacci (recursively and dynamically)       Codded in C++  

Compiled in docker with gcc:15.2-trixie

When ran the program will prompt the user to to select the recursive algorithm or the dynamic algorithm, then they will be asked to enter n 
which is the Fibonacci number they want to calculate. 

After displaying the results the user will be asked to select another algorithm or if the user wants to look at some statics about the
algorithms they can choose to generate a spreadsheet with that information. 

At anytime the user can hit option 4 to exit the program.
